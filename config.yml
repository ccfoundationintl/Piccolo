  donation_email_text: "Since 2003, Wake Forest students and faculty have gathered on Hearn Plaza, running laps around the quad to raise money for the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund.  Hit The Bricks is the largest student-run philanthropy event on campus and has become a beloved cornerstone tradition at Wake Forest.  The event brings together the entire campus community, as hundreds of students pledge to stay on their feet for twelve hours in honor and in memory of those who have battled cancer.  This year we are bringing Hit The Bricks to the Nation's Capital.<br><br>I have pledged to participate in Hit The Bricks: DC on October 1, 2016. Though I won't be running for twelve hours, I will be completing laps on the National Mall with fellow alumni, friends and family.  This event directly benefits the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund, which supports innovative research at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Since it was founded in 1980, the Brian Piccolo Cancer Research Fund has raised over $1.7 million through the efforts of our generous sponsors and dedicated donors.<br><br>I am hoping that you will consider making a contribution on my behalf for this event.  All donations are secure, easy, and tax-deductible. With your help, we are one step closer to our goal of raising over $200,000! "
